requires:
  - phase: 06-reflection-agent/06-01
    provides: ReflectionReport type, REFLECTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT
  - phase: 06-reflection-agent/06-02
    provides: POST /api/reflection/run streaming route, shouldTriggerReflection function

provides:
  - ReflectionPanel 'use client' component with streaming fetch, 5 expandable sections, action buttons
  - 11 TDD tests for ReflectionPanel covering button states, badge, sections, action hrefs
  - Weekly review page integration with threshold badge and ReflectionPanel in both empty/non-empty states

affects:
  - 07-reflect-page (reflection_sessions populated by this workflow; UI patterns established here)

tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "Streaming client pattern: fetch POST + response.body.getReader() + TextDecoder + setState accumulation"
    - "initialReport prop for testability: bypasses streaming state machine, renders done state directly"
    - "ActionButton sub-component: null target_node_id = plain text label (no link), regardless of action_type"
    - "<details><summary> expandable sections for structured LLM output rendering"

  created:
    - src/components/review/__tests__/ReflectionPanel.test.tsx
    - src/app/review/ReflectionPanel.tsx
  modified:
    - src/app/review/page.tsx

key-decisions:
  - "reframe action_type with null target_node_id renders plain text label — the general override rule (null target = no link) takes precedence over the reframe-specific rule (link to /capture/new)"
  - "initialReport prop added for test isolation — allows rendering done state without mocking streaming infrastructure"
  - "Empty state return wrapped in max-w-5xl div to host ReflectionPanel consistently with non-empty layout"

patterns-established:
  - "Streaming state machine: idle -> running (stream starts) -> done (stream ends) -> error (non-2xx or network failure)"
  - "useMemo for parsedReport: depends on [status, rawOutput, initialReport] — memoizes expensive JSON.parse"

# Phase 6 Plan 03: ReflectionPanel UI Summary

**ReflectionPanel 'use client' component with live streaming from /api/reflection/run, 5 expandable sections (Patterns, Contradictions, Coverage Gaps, Trajectory, Recommendations), stop/strengthen/reframe action buttons, teal threshold badge, and weekly review page integration with shouldTriggerReflection**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-30T14:31:31Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-30T14:36:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (+ 1 checkpoint awaiting human verification)
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments

- 11 TDD tests covering button states, reflectionDue badge, all 5 section headings, action button hrefs (stop/strengthen link to /capture/{id}/review, reframe with target links to /capture/new), null action_type renders no link
- ReflectionPanel with streaming fetch, progressive rawOutput display, parsedReport useMemo parsing, and `initialReport` prop for test isolation
- Weekly review page updated with parallel reflection_sessions and node count queries, shouldTriggerReflection computation, and ReflectionPanel in both empty and non-empty render paths

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1 RED: add failing tests for ReflectionPanel** - `5eaabd0` (test)
2. **Task 2 GREEN: implement ReflectionPanel client component** - `ea31ac6` (feat)
3. **Task 3: integrate ReflectionPanel into weekly review page** - `8c47b79` (feat)

_Note: TDD task split into RED (test) and GREEN (feat) commits_

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/review/__tests__/ReflectionPanel.test.tsx` - 11 TDD tests for ReflectionPanel: button states, badge, 5 sections, action button hrefs, null action_type
- `src/app/review/ReflectionPanel.tsx` - 'use client' component: streaming fetch, state machine, 5 expandable sections, ActionButton sub-component
- `src/app/review/page.tsx` - Added reflection queries to Promise.all, shouldTriggerReflection computation, ReflectionPanel in both render paths

## Decisions Made

- `reframe + null target_node_id` renders plain text label, not a link — the null-target override rule takes precedence over the reframe-specific redirect to `/capture/new`
- `initialReport` prop added for test isolation — avoids mocking fetch/ReadableStream in unit tests while covering all rendering paths
- Empty state return wrapped in `max-w-5xl` container so ReflectionPanel appears consistently in both empty and non-empty states

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Fixed ActionButton logic for reframe + null target_node_id**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (GREEN phase — running tests)
- **Issue:** Initial implementation sent reframe always to `/capture/new` regardless of target_node_id, but the test (per plan's "null target = no link" override rule) expects plain text label
- **Fix:** Changed href resolution to check `targetNodeId === null` first — returns null (plain text) before checking action_type
- **Files modified:** src/app/review/ReflectionPanel.tsx
- **Verification:** All 11 tests pass after fix
- **Committed in:** ea31ac6 (Task 2 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (Rule 1 - logic bug in ActionButton href resolution)
**Impact on plan:** Essential for correct action button routing. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered

- Worktree was initialized from an older commit that predated Phase 06 work. Resolved by merging `v0.4` into the worktree branch before starting execution — all Phase 06 files (reflection.ts, convergence.ts, run/route.ts) were present after the merge.
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors in `DashboardSidebar.test.tsx` and `InlineCaptureCard.test.tsx` (vitest globals TS2582/TS2304) cause `npx tsc --noEmit` to exit non-zero — these are pre-existing and not caused by this plan. New files compile cleanly.

## User Setup Required

None — no external service configuration required. The reflection_sessions migration SQL (created in Plan 01) must be applied in Supabase before the streaming endpoint and threshold badge work end-to-end.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Task 4 (checkpoint:human-verify) is awaiting human verification of streaming UX, section rendering, and action button routing
- Once verified: Phase 06-reflection-agent is complete, Phase 07 can begin
- reflection_sessions migration must be applied in Supabase before E2E verification can confirm the threshold badge
