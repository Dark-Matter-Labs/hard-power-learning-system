# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-27)

**Core value:** The system must always tell you whether your exploration and your commitments are spiraling together toward your goals — or apart.
**Current focus:** Phase 07 — reflection-session-page

## Current Position

Phase: 07 (reflection-session-page) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 2
Status: Executing Phase 07
Last activity: 2026-03-30 -- Phase 07 execution started

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 57%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v0.4 init: Trajectory badge (Option C) chosen over spiral SVG — practical for v0.4; spiral deferred to design pass
- v0.4 init: Rough convergence weights (not ML) — purpose is visibility, tune over real usage
- v0.4 init: Scheduled reflection cron deferred to v0.5 — on-demand + threshold sufficient for v0.4
- [Phase 02-goal-space-panel]: computeOutcomeStatus checks blocked before met — falsified/suspended source nodes take priority regardless of edge type
- [Phase 02-goal-space-panel]: getOutcomeHunchCount filters by node_type === hunch to exclude intervention nodes from count
- [Phase 02-goal-space-panel]: STATUS_DISPLAY map encodes symbol + colorClass per OutcomeStatus — decoupled from status logic in queries.ts
- [Phase 02-goal-space-panel]: Count text uses text-[10px] per UI-SPEC (not text-[9px] from research skeleton)
- [Phase 03-capture-linking-extraction]: Added goal_relevance and expected_signals to LlmExtraction type (03-01 parallel dependency)
- [Phase 03-capture-linking-extraction]: goalRelevanceActions stored separately from fields in ReviewCard to isolate goal relevance state
- [Phase 03-capture-linking-extraction]: targets_outcome edges created at promotion time by scanning goal_relevance_* keys in review.fields
- [Phase 04-convergence-computation]: no_attention penalty applies only when zero targets_outcome AND zero assigned_to_outcome edges — indicates_progress edges alone do not count as attention
- [Phase 04-convergence-computation]: falsified/suspended status overrides positive weight — node contributes only negative factor, positive evaluation is skipped
- [Phase 05-trajectory-indicators]: maybeSingle() used for latest snapshot query — single() throws when no rows, maybeSingle() returns null
- [Phase 05-trajectory-indicators]: d3 domain fixed at [-10, 10] matching computeConvergenceScore clamping range — consistent y-axis scaling
- [Phase 05-trajectory-indicators]: Separate queries for latest (with factor_breakdown) and history (lean: score + computed_at only)
- [Phase 05-trajectory-indicators]: Render weight and node_title in separate spans in breakdown panel — allows CSS class targeting and cleaner DOM
- [Phase 05-trajectory-indicators]: GoalSpacePanel gets use client directive — needed for useState/useEffect convergence fetch
- [Phase 06-reflection-agent]: parseReflectionResponse validates all 5 required fields individually with descriptive errors — fail-fast approach
- [Phase 06-reflection-agent]: REFLECTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT uses numbered directives for author blind spots and stop/strengthen/reframe action_type — contractual directives testable in unit tests
- [Phase 06-reflection-agent]: ReadableStream created only after all pre-flight checks pass — prevents streaming to unauthorized or rate-limited clients
- [Phase 06-reflection-agent]: activityByAuthor uses nodes-by-author reduce (activity_log table does not exist)
- [Phase 06-reflection-agent]: reframe action_type with null target_node_id renders plain text label — null-target override rule takes precedence over reframe-specific redirect to /capture/new
- [Phase 06-reflection-agent]: initialReport prop added to ReflectionPanel for test isolation — avoids mocking fetch/ReadableStream in unit tests while covering all rendering paths

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 depends on Phase 1 (trigger_outcome nodes must exist before capture dropdown can list them)
- Phase 7 depends on both Phase 5 (sparklines) and Phase 6 (reflection agent) — plan accordingly
