# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-31)

**Core value:** The system must always tell you whether your exploration and your commitments are spiraling together toward your goals — or apart.
**Current focus:** Phase 13 — Edit Nodes & Connections

## Current Position

Phase: 13 (Edit Nodes & Connections) — COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-04-01

Progress: [█████████░] 92%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0 (v0.5)
- Average duration: ~18 min (v0.4 reference)
- Total execution time: -

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans (v0.4): 15min, 15min, 15min, 18min, 53min
- Trend: Stable (spikes on complex LLM work)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v0.5 init: Opt-out review model — Robyn rejects bad extraction, not approves good ones
- v0.5 init: Shared CAPTURE_TYPES config prevents drift between full capture page and inline graph card
- v0.5 init: insight_date falls back to created_at in timeline — no data loss for existing nodes
- v0.5 init: File upload stores original in Supabase Storage, extracted text pre-populates description
- [Phase 08-layout-theme]: isDark check placed once at top of useEffect body in GraphCanvas — captures theme at render time, no reactive listener needed
- [Phase 08-layout-theme]: Filter pill inactive state moved from inline style to Tailwind className conditional — enables dark: variants; active state keeps inline style for dynamic type color
- [Phase 08-layout-theme]: D3 SVG pattern: read isDark once before createElement calls, define named constants for all color variants
- [Phase 08-layout-theme]: NodeTypeBadge and StatusBadge require no dark: changes — opaque colored chip backgrounds are mode-invariant
- [Phase 08-layout-theme]: TensionAlertItem severity alerts use tinted light backgrounds (red-50, amber-50) paired with dark: variants for the original dark tints
- [Phase 08-layout-theme]: Undirected hunches card amber border left as semantic; only bg updated to light+dark pair
- [Phase 08-layout-theme]: text-gray-500 section subheaders left unchanged per color mapping table (same in both modes)
- [Phase 09-review-ux]: Opt-out review model: fields pre-accepted by default via buildInitialFields lazy useState initializer — inverts friction for common accept-all case
- [Phase 09-review-ux]: handlePromoteAll builds HumanReview from local variables not state reads to avoid stale closure pitfall
- [Phase 10-capture-foundation]: getCaptureType cast uses Parameters<typeof getCaptureType>[0] — keeps type safety without duplicating CaptureTypeId union
- [Phase 10-capture-foundation]: Meeting child node llm_extraction mirrors LlmExtraction shape — child nodes flow through existing ReviewCard unchanged
- [Phase 10-capture-foundation]: Review page shows child list only when meeting_notes AND children exist — gracefully handles still-processing state
- [Phase 11-date-timeline]: insight_date is nullable TIMESTAMPTZ — existing nodes retain NULL and fall back to created_at in timeline
- [Phase 11-date-timeline]: meeting_notes capture type excluded from insight_date field — meeting_date already serves this purpose; passed as insight_date at API level
- [Phase 11-date-timeline]: getTimelineDate helper centralises insight_date ?? created_at fallback — single change point for future modifications
- [Phase 12-people-participants]: personNodes status filter uses promoted/human_reviewed matching the promote handler scope — person nodes follow same promotion pipeline
- [Phase 12-people-participants]: formatEdgeType helper in ConnectionSuggestion renders mentioned_in as "Mentioned in" — display formatting decoupled from edge type value
- [Phase 12-people-participants]: participated_in edge type for manual participant tagging (semantically distinct from authored_by); mentioned_in for extraction-detected mentions
- [Phase 13-edit-nodes-connections]: Status select restricted to promoted/archived/falsified/suspended — system states hidden from users
- [Phase 13-edit-nodes-connections]: NODE_TYPE_OPTIONS defined inline in NodeDetailPanel to keep component self-contained
- [Phase 13-edit-nodes-connections]: Remove button uses opacity-0 group-hover pattern — visible on hover only to reduce visual noise
- [Phase 13-edit-nodes-connections]: addEdgeType state typed as string to allow select onChange assignment without type narrowing issues
- [Phase 13-edit-nodes-connections]: Connections section always rendered in view mode to keep Add connection button always accessible
