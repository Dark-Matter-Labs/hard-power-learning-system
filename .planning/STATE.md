## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v0.5 init: Opt-out review model — Robyn rejects bad extraction, not approves good ones
- v0.5 init: Shared CAPTURE_TYPES config prevents drift between full capture page and inline graph card
- v0.5 init: insight_date falls back to created_at in timeline — no data loss for existing nodes
- v0.5 init: File upload stores original in Supabase Storage, extracted text pre-populates description
- [Phase 08-layout-theme]: isDark check placed once at top of useEffect body in GraphCanvas — captures theme at render time, no reactive listener needed
- [Phase 08-layout-theme]: Filter pill inactive state moved from inline style to Tailwind className conditional — enables dark: variants; active state keeps inline style for dynamic type color
- [Phase 08-layout-theme]: D3 SVG pattern: read isDark once before createElement calls, define named constants for all color variants
- [Phase 08-layout-theme]: NodeTypeBadge and StatusBadge require no dark: changes — opaque colored chip backgrounds are mode-invariant
- [Phase 08-layout-theme]: TensionAlertItem severity alerts use tinted light backgrounds (red-50, amber-50) paired with dark: variants for the original dark tints
- [Phase 08-layout-theme]: Undirected hunches card amber border left as semantic; only bg updated to light+dark pair
- [Phase 08-layout-theme]: text-gray-500 section subheaders left unchanged per color mapping table (same in both modes)
- [Phase 09-review-ux]: Opt-out review model: fields pre-accepted by default via buildInitialFields lazy useState initializer — inverts friction for common accept-all case
- [Phase 09-review-ux]: handlePromoteAll builds HumanReview from local variables not state reads to avoid stale closure pitfall
